    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I realised the code for each line is almost identical and so just copied and pasted it changing it very slightly.</td>

    <td> At the end of the lesson when I added my colours I could have spent the time asking about extra work so I would have been ahead. Also I could have realised that I could copy and paste the alphabet and so I could have been quicker.</td>
