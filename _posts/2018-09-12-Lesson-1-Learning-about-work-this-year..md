    <td>Persevering</td>

    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I didn’t really use this one this week.</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>We were told that using a google font would be very good so by myself I found out how to inbred a google font and did so.</td>

    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>When my website wouldn’t publish I remembered back to last year when I had the same problem and so knew how to fix it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>We had to listen to quite a lot of talking from our teachers the beginning of the lesson and so I was engaged for that.</td>

    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>When we got set to work on our blogs I should’ve used JSbin to test my code but instead I just tried to do it through github. This was a lot slower and so didn’t get as much done. Also I had sort of forgotten bits of vital code and so I needed a bit of time to remember them.</td>

    <td>Next time I will use JSbin first to make sure that my changes work and I will remember good pieces of code so I can use them in the future. Also I will remember how to name my website properly.</td>
