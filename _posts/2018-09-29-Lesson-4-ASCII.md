<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>A working Shift Cypher that encyphered and decyphered.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To make a working ASCII sheet.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, I also did it with ASCII Binary and Hexidecimal.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

  <tr>
    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I persevered with setting up the table to quite a bit shorter than my shift cypher table.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I questioned with to use decimal, binary or hexidecimal but in the end I realised it didn't really matter that much if I had all three working.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>By myself I found an ASCII table that I could copy into the sheet and so I didnâ€™t have to type it all up.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Be reflecting on previous lessons I was able to realise that the code was almost identicle I just needed a different table.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I had to be engaged at the beginning in order to realise what we were doing and how ASCII worked.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<table>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have just used all three bases from the beginning  and I probably could have copy and pasted code across from my shift cyphers sheet in order to do the work quicker. Also I could have thought of copying and pasting the table across earlier.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time if I am in doubt I will use all of the possibilities so to save time. Also I will copy and paste code that is nearly identicle to also save time. And I will think about a quicker solution imediatly, instead of trying some slower ones first.</td>
    <td></td>
